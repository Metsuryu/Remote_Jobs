# Remote_Jobs

### What

A list of websites to find remote dev jobs.

I'll keep updating the list as I try new ones.

### Why

I'm making this list because I found the process of looking for a remote job to be inefficient and tedious, so this might help me and potentially other people to do this in a better way.

Feel free to suggest new ones with pull requests.

## List

#### High tier (Has every feature I want)

*Can filter remote jobs and has other search filters.

* [angel.co](https://angel.co/) - Under "Location" select "Remote OK".   
It's mostly startups, so many of them offer only equity, but quite a few offer money.   
There are many jobs, the search filters are good, and it's easy to apply, meaning the response rate fairly high, so it's one of the best sites I've tried so far.

* [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs?sort=i&r=true) - Under "Perks" enable "Offers remote".  
There aren't many job posts usually, but the jobs tend to be of higher quality.

* [authenticjobs](https://www.authenticjobs.com)*

* [whoishiring](https://whoishiring.io/)*

* [landing.jobs](https://landing.jobs/jobs?page=1&remote=true)*

* [nofluffjobs](https://nofluffjobs.com/#/criteria=remote=100)*

* [peopleperhour](https://www.peopleperhour.com)*
* [RemoteML](https://remoteml.com/)*


#### Medium tier (Lacks one or more features I want)

* [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/) - Can't really search for remote jobs specifically, have to use the search function that is not great.

* [indeed](https://www.indeed.com) - As above, must use the search function with something like "Remote Web Developer", not very efficient.

* [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/) - There are a lot of jobs listed, but there is also a lot of comptetition, and clients tend to hire devs that can work for very low pay, making it even harder to get hired.

* [guru.com](http://www.guru.com) - Can search jobs in "Any location" but there doesn't seem to be an option specifically for remote jobs.

* [loom.co](https://www.loom.co) - Can't search for remote jobs specifically. Most jobs offer only equity, but some offer cash.

* [Codestunts](https://codestunts.com/) - Software development only, allows freelancers from EU and US

* [Codeable](https://codeable.io/) - Lots of wordpress work, but you must pass an interview to be able to apply to jobs.
